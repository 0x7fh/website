Why could I?

Unfortunately, the GitHub wiki only provides two roles.  One can't modify anything while the other can edit, delete, or create new pages.  The delete page link doesn't ask for confirmation and so we get pages accidentally deleted.  We have to live with it if we want to allow users to edit the wiki (and we do).  Don't worry about it and thanks for promptly reverting.
