==============

This is the fledgeling set of documentation about the Architecture of sbt.  This will cover all the core components of
sbt as well as the general notion of how they all work together.  This documentation is suitable for those who wish to
have a deeper understanding of sbt's core, but already understand the fundamentals of ``Setting[_]``, ``Task[_]`` and
constructing builds.
