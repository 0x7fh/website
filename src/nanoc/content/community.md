## How you can help

sbt is an open source project and everyone is encouraged to get involved!
Join the commuity of developers building sbt and related tools like Play and Activator.

### Contribute to StackOverflow

Stack Overflow is a Q&A site for programmers. 
Asking and answering questions on [StackOverflow's sbt tag][so] is a great way to share knowledge about sbt.
Users can vote on each others' contributions and earn reputation points.

### Report bugs

When you find a bug in sbt we want to hear about it.
Your bug reports play an important part in making sbt more reliable and usable.
sbt uses [GitHub to track issues][issues].

When you report bugs, make sure to distinguish facts and opinions.
What we need first is the exact steps to reproduce your problems on **our computers**.
If not reproducible tests, include `build.sbt`, version numbers, your method of running `sbt`,
example code, or anything else you think might help.

Next, describe the problems, or what *you think* is the problem.
It might be obvious to you that it's a problem, but it could actually be an intentional behavior.
The same goes for expectations. Describe what *you think* should've happened. 

### Patch the core

sbt's code is hosted on Github [sbt/sbt][github] repository,
and sbt's documentation (including this page) is on [sbt/website][website] repository.
sbt development is discussed on the [sbt-dev list][ml] and
on [Gitter sbt/sbt][gitter].
You can ask on the list or the chat if you have any questions regarding sbt development.

You're welcome to work on any feature you like but if you'd like some good ideas,
look for issues tagged with the [Community label][community-label].

### Create plugins

Plugins extend the power of sbt and Play.
Writing a new plugin is often easier than patching sbt's core code. 
Check out the list of [community plugins][Community-Plugins].
