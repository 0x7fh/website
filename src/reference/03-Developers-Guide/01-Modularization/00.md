### Modularization

The process we aim to take for sbt 1.0 is to disassemble sbt into small modules.
To be clear sbt 0.13's codebase already does consists of numerous subprojects.

Modules are more course-grained sets of subproject(s) that can be used independently.
Another purpose of the modules is to distinguish between public API and internal implementation.
Reducing the surface area of the sbt code base have several benefits:

- It makes it easier for the build users and the plugin authors to learn the APIs.
- It makes it easier for us to maintain binary and semantic compatibilities.
- It encourages the reuse of the modules.

The following is a conceptual diagram of the modules:

We'll discuss the details in the next page.
