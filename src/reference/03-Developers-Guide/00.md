Developer's Guide (Work in progress)
------------------------------------

This is the set of documentation about the Architecture of sbt.
The target audience of this document is the sbt plugin authors
and sbt developers. See also [How can I help?][HowCanIHelp]

### Modularization

The process we aim to take for sbt 1.0 is to disassemble sbt into small modules.
To be clear sbt 0.13's codebase already does consists of numerous subprojects.

Here's what we envision the modilarization process to look like:

- pull apart subprojects by feature
- make separate Github repositories
- distinguish public API and internal implemention
- document the usages
- clean up the code since we can break bincompat
- publish to Maven

Here are some of the modules.

#### [sbt/serialization](https://github.com/sbt/serialization)

sbt serialization is an opinionated wrapper around [Scala Pickling][pickling] focused on sbt's usage.

#### [launcher][Sbt-Launcher]

The sbt launcher provides a generic container that can load and run
programs resolved using the Ivy dependency manager. Sbt uses this as its
own deployment mechanism. (Hosted at [sbt/launcher](https://github.com/sbt/launcher))

#### [sbt/website](https://github.com/sbt/website)

This website's source.

#### [sbt/sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt)

Most of the sbt codebase still lives here.

### Towards sbt 1.0

On 2008-12-18, Mark Harrah announced sbt 0.3.2 as the initial release of sbt.
Mark remained the primary author of sbt until sbt 0.13.1 (2013-12-11).
In 2014, sbt project was handed over to the authors of this document Josh Suereth
and Eugene Yokota.

As we move towards sbt 1.0, we wish to stablize what's already stable
and innovate where it matters. There are several levels of stability:

- conceptual stability
- source compatibility of the build defnition
- binary compatibility of the plugins

#### Concepts

Concepturally we are stable on what sbt does:

1. incremental compilation that supports Scala
2. dependency management that's aware of Scala's binary compatibility
3. task and plugins system that's extensible using Scala
4. a text-based interactive shell

The only thing that will change is the last point.
In sbt 1.0, we will replace the interactive shell with sbt server
that's accessible via JSON API and a text-based client.

#### Source compatibility of the build deinition

Source compatibility means that a build source that worked for sbt version A
works for another version B without modification.
For example, a build defition created for sbt 1.0.0 should work also for sbt 1.1.0
(if we adopted Semantic Versioning).

#### Binary compatibility of the plugins

Binary compatibility ("bincompat") of the plugins means that a plugin
that was published  for sbt version A works for another version B without recompilaition.
sbt 0.13 has kept binary compatibility for 18 months as of March 2015.
The stability here helps maintaining sbt plug ecosystem.

From the development perspective, maintaining binary compatibility becomes
an additional constraint that we need to worry about whenever we make changes.
The of the problem is that sbt 0.13 does not distinguish between public API
and internal impelmentation. Most things are open to plugins.
