Developer's Guide
-----------------

This is the set of documentation about the Architecture of sbt. This
covers all the core components of sbt as well as the general notion of
how they all work together. This documentation is suitable for those who
wish to have a deeper understanding of sbt's core, but already
understand the fundamentals of `Setting[_]`, `Task[_]` and constructing
builds.
