## sbt 0.13.5+ Technology Previews

sbt 0.13.5+ releases of sbt are technology previews of what's to come to sbt 1.0 with enhancements like [auto plugins][Auto-Plugins-Post], launcher enhacements for sbt server, defined in the sbt-remote-control project, and other necessary API changes.

These releases maintain binary compatibility with plugins that are published against sbt 0.13.0, but add new features in preparation for sbt 1.0. The tech previews allow us to test new ideas like auto plugins and performance improvements on dependency resolution; the build users can try new features without losing the existing plugin resources; and plugin authors can gradually migrate to the new plugin system before sbt 1.0 arrives.

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- Maven artifact dependencies will limit their transitive dependencies to `Compile` rather than *every configuration* if no `master` configuration is found. [#1586][1586] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- The new natural whitspace handling parser is unable to cope with certain classes of Scala syntax. In particular, top-level pattern matches, or multi-value defintions are no longer supported.

Here are examples:

```scala
val x, y = project // BAD
val x = project    // 
val y = project    //  GOOD
```

### Improvements

- Natural whitespace handling. See below. [#1606][1606] by [@rkrzewski][@rkrzewski], [@ajozwik][@ajozwik], and others at [@WarsawScala][@WarsawScala]
- Adds support for publishing to a custom Maven local repository. See below. [#1589][1589]/[#1600][1600] by [@topping][@topping]
- Adds circular dependency check. See below. [#1601][1601] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Adds cached resolution (minigraph caching). See below. [#1631][1631] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Allows the "-bin" Scala version suffix to specify a bincompat version. [#1573][1573] by [@cunei][@cunei]
- Adds support for publishing to file repositories specified in `~/.sbt/repositories`. [#1579][1579] by [@copumpkin][@copumpkin]
- Adds support for publishing to a Maven repository with `file` URLs. [#1618][1618] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Don't hardcode existing relations in `TextAnalysisFormat`. [#1572][1572] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Adds `developers` key. [#1590][1590] by [@jedesah][@jedesah]
- Will warn when none or multiple main classes detected. [#1648][1648] by [@kretes][@kretes]

### Bug fixes

- Fixes issues with specifying `scalaHome`/`scalaInstance` and running tests. [#1584][1584] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Fixes StackOverflow error in dependencies extraction with macro and name hashing. [#1563][1563]/[#1642][1642]/[#1237][1237]/[#1544][1544] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Fixes `set every`. [#1591][1591]/[#1430][1430] by [@cunei][@cunei]
- Ivy no longer silently flops to `HttpClient` resolver when httpclient is on the classpath. [#1602][1602] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Backports Ivy fix to not throw exceptions when modules are evicted.  [#1607][1607]/[#1598][1598] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- When resolving from a Maven repository, and unable to read `maven-metadata.xml` file (common given the divergence in
  Maven 3 and Ivy 2), we attempt to use `LastModified` timestamp in lieu of "published" timestamp.  
  [#1611][1611]/[#1618][1618] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Fixes NullPointerException when using `ChainResolver` and Maven repositories. [#1611][1611]/[#1618][1618] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Fixes `Resolver`'s `url` method dropping `descriptorOptional` and `skipConsistencyCheck`. [#1621][1621] by [@tmandke][@tmandke]
- Revert `useLatestSnapshot` on `updateOptions` to default to `false`.  Reverts chain resolver to previous behavior.  [#1683][1683] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]

### Natural whitespace handling

Starting sbt 0.13.7, build.sbt will be parsed using a customized Scala parser. This eliminates the requirement to use blank line as the delimiter between each settings, and also allows blank lines to be inserted at arbitrary position within a block.

This feature can be disabled, if necessary, via the -Dsbt.parser.simple=true flag.

This feature was contributed by [Andrzej Jozwik (@ajozwik)](https://github.com/ajozwik), [Rafał Krzewski (@rkrzewski)][@rkrzewski] and others at [@WarsawScala][@WarsawScala] inspired by Typesafe's [@gkossakowski][@gkossakowski] organizing multiple [meetups](http://blog.japila.pl/2014/07/gkossakowski-on-warszawscala-about-how-to-patch-scalasbt/) and [hackathons](http://blog.japila.pl/2014/07/hacking-scalasbt-with-gkossakowski-on-warszawscala-meetup-in-javeo_eu/) on how to patch sbt with the focus on this blank line issue. Dziękujemy! [#1606][1606]

### Custom Maven local repository location

Maven local repository is now resolved from the first of:

- `<localRepository/>` element in `~/.m2/settings.xml`
- `<localRepository/>` element in `\$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml`, or
- the default of `~/.m2/repository` if neither of those configuration elements exist

If more Maven settings are required to be recovered, the proper thing to do is merge the two possible `settings.xml` files, then query against the element path of the merge. This code avoids the merge by checking sequentially.

[#1589][1589]/[#1600][1600] by [@topping][@topping]

### Circular dependency

By default circular dependencies are warned, but they do not halt the dependency resolution. Using the following setting, circular dependencies can be treated as an error.

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withCircularDependencyLevel(CircularDependencyLevel.Error)

[#1601][1601] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Cached resolution (minigraph caching)

sbt 0.13.7 adds a new **experimental** update option called *cached resolution*, which replaces consolidated resolution:

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withCachedResolution(true)

Unlike consolidated resolution, which only consolidated subprojects with identical dependency graph, cached resolution create an artificial graph for each direct dependency (minigraph) for all subprojects, resolves them independently, saves them into json file, and stiches the minigraphs together.

Once the minigraphs are resolved and saved as files, dependency resolution turns into a matter of loading json file from the second run onwards, which should complete in a matter of seconds even for large projects. Also, because the files are saved under a global `~/.sbt/0.13/dependency` (or what's specified by `sbt.dependency.base` flag), the resolution result is shared across all builds.

Breaking graphs into minigraphs allows partial resolution results to be shared, which scales better for subprojects with similar but slightly different dependencies, and also for making small changes to the dependencies graph over time. See [documentation on cached resolution][Cached-Resolution] for more details.

[#1494][1494] by [@rtyley][@rtyley], [#1536][1536] by [@benmccann][@benmccann], and [#1541][1541] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n].

### enablePlugins/disablePlugins

sbt 0.13.6 now allows `enablePlugins` and `disablePlugins` to be written directly in `build.sbt`. [#1213][1213]/[#1312][1312] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]

### Unresolved dependencies error

sbt 0.13.6 will try to reconstruct dependencies tree when it fails to resolve a managed dependency.
This is an approximation, but it should help you figure out where the problematic dependency is coming from. When possible sbt will display the source position next to the modules:

    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn]  ::          UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES         ::
    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn]  :: foundrylogic.vpp#vpp;2.2.1: not found
    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn] 
    [warn]  Note: Unresolved dependencies path:
    [warn]      foundrylogic.vpp:vpp:2.2.1
    [warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne:cayenne-tools:3.0.2
    [warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne.plugins:maven-cayenne-plugin:3.0.2 (/foo/some-test/build.sbt#L28)
    [warn]        +- d:d_2.10:0.1-SNAPSHOT

[#528][528]/[#1422][1422]/[#1447][1447] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Eviction warnings

sbt 0.13.6 displays eviction warnings when it resolves your project's managed dependencies via `update` task.
Currently the eviction warnings are categorized into three layers: `scalaVersion` eviction, direct evictions, and transitive evictions.
By default eviction warning on `update` task will display only `scalaVersion` evictin and direct evictions.

`scalaVersion` eviction warns you when `scalaVersion` is no longer effecitive. This happens when one of your dependency depends on a newer release of scala-library than your `scalaVersion`.
Direct evctions are evictions related to your direct dependencies. Warnings are displayed only when API incompatibility is suspected. For Java libraries, Semantic Versioning is used for guessing, and for Scala libraries Second Segment versioning (second segment bump makes API incompatible) is used.

To display all eviction warnings with caller information, run `evicted` task.

    [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
    [warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
    [warn]     * com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.10:2.1.4 -> 2.3.4 (caller: com.typesafe.akka:akka-remote_2.10:2.3.4,
    org.w3:banana-sesame_2.10:0.4, org.w3:banana-rdf_2.10:0.4)

[#1200][1200]/[#1467][1467] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Latest SNAPSHOTs

sbt 0.13.6 adds a new setting key called `updateOptions` for customizing the details of managed dependency resolution with `update` task. One of its flags is called `lastestSnapshots`, which controls the behavior of the chained resolver. Up until 0.13.6, sbt was picking the first `-SNAPSHOT` revision it found along the chain. When `latestSnapshots` is enabled (default: `true`), it will look into all resolvers on the chain, and compare them using the publish date.

The tradeoff is probably a longer resolution time if you have many remote repositories on the build or you live away from the severs. So here's how to disable it:

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withLatestSnapshots(false)

[#1514][1514] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Consolidated resolution

`updateOptions` can also be used to enable consolidated resolution for `update` task.

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withConsolidatedResolution(true)

This feature is specifically targeted to address [Ivy resolution is beging slow for multi-module projects #413][413]. Consolidated resolution aims to fix this issue by artificially constructing an Ivy dependency graph for the unique managed dependencies. If two subprojects introduce identical external dependencies, both subprojects should consolidate to the same graph, and therefore resolve immediately for the second `update`. [#1454][1454] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

## sbt 0.13.5

  [Auto-Plugins-Post]: https://typesafe.com/blog/preview-of-upcoming-sbt-10-features-read-about-the-new-plugins

sbt 0.13.5 is a technology preview of what's to come to sbt 1.0 with enhancements like [auto plugins][Auto-Plugins-Post] and the necessary APIs changes and launcher for "sbt as a server.", defined in the sbt-remote-control project.

- The Scala version for sbt and sbt plugins is now 2.10.4. This is a compatible version bump.
- Added a new setting testResultLogger to allow customisation of logging of test results. (#1225)
- When test is run and there are no tests available, omit logging output. Especially useful for aggregate modules. test-only et al unaffected. (#1185)
- sbt now uses minor-patch version of ivy 2.3 (org.scala-sbt.ivy:ivy:2.3.0-sbt-<git sha>)
- `sbt.Plugin` deprecated in favor of `sbt.AutoPlugin`
- name-hashing incremental compiler now supports scala macros.
- `testResultLogger` is now configured.
- sbt-server hooks for task cancellation.
- Add `JUnitXmlReportPlugin` which generates junit-xml-reports for all tests.
- Optionally enable forced garbage collection after tasks (`-Dsbt.task.forcegc=true`).
